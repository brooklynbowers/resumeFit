### **This project analyzes the following goal:**

*Compare a resume against a job description*

---

### **Identifying Skills and Qualifications**

**Complexity in Texts:**

- Job descriptions and individuals' resumes are both complex and unstructured
 - This is because they can vary greatly in format, wording, and the way information is presented
 - For example, the same skill might be presented in resumes very differently
    - "Experienced in Java programming" vs
    - "Java development proficiency"
  - Similarly, job descriptions might list required skills in various ways

**Contextual Understanding:**

For this project, we need the AI to be able to understand context to differentiate between:
  - Essential skills, such as:
    - *Project management*
    - *Software development*
    - *Financial analysis*
  - Desirable skills, such as:
    -  *Public speaking*
    - *Agile project management*
    - *Multilingual communication*
  - Certifications, such as:
    - *PMP (Project Management Professional)*
    - *CPA (Certified Public Accountant)*
    - *CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate)*
  - Personal attributes, such as:
    - *Team player*
    - *Highly organized*
    - *Innovative thinker*

### **Comparing the Extracted Information**

**Matching Varied Expressions:**

The system must recognize when different expressions refer to the same skill or qualification.
- This involves being able to understand
  - Synonyms
  - Related technologies
    - i.e., recognizing that experience in React is relevant to a job asking for JavaScript framework experience
  - Levels of expertise.

**Identifying Skill Gaps:**

The system must also recognize when and be able to highlight what's missing
  - This can be challenging:
    - Job descriptions are often vague  
    - Job descriptions might list many qualifications without specifying which are most important

---



### **Estimating Qualification Level**


**Quantitative vs. Qualitative Assessment:**

Quantifying the match between a resume and a job description is very complex.
- Giving a percentage may not give much information about the correlation between the two
  - i.e., if a candidate lacks one critical skill but has many less important ones

**Setting Thresholds:**

Determining what percentage or level of match qualifies as a good fit for a job is another challenge
- This is because different jobs and industries might require different thresholds for job entry

### **Identifying Areas for Improvement**


**Personalized Recommendations:**

Providing tailored advice on improving a resume for a specific job description requires:
  - Being able to identifying gaps in the resume
  - Understanding the career path and industry trends


**Prioritization of Suggestions: **

Some resume gaps are more critical to address than others
  - The application we create should help users prioritize which skills or qualifications to work on first
    - This can be based on their current skill level
    - This can also be based on how important their missing skills are on the job application

### **Ethical and Practical Considerations**

**Bias Mitigation:**

In order to provide an equal service to all users, we will need to ensure that the system doesn't perpetuate biases present in job descriptions or resumes
  - This includes being mindful of how skills are valued
  - Also includes avoiding discrimination based on personal attributes

**User Privacy and Data Security:**

Safeguarding user data, especially sensitive information in resumes, is very important. The system must be designed with privacy and security in mind.
